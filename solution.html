 <h1> Let's think of what we have to do for slowing down of global warming. </h1>
 <h2>The main reason of climate change is global warming as you can see. First of all, we need to reduce the amount of emission of green house gas. In addition, a surprising thing is that it will take at least 100 years to 300 years to come back industrial revolution times, which means that global warming will continue though we stop everything now. What i want to say is that because climate change is not personal or national affair,but global problem, Cooperation among all members of society around the world is required.</h2>
 	<h3> < There are three representative things that we can do. ></h3>
 	<h4>1. we need to save the amount of usage of all kinds of energy  at home or workplace.</h4>
 		<h5> 2. we need to use the product which is high energy efficiency and makes low waste.- Methane which is one of the green house gases occurs a lot when the waste burns.</h5>
 			<h6> 3.Tree is very useful absorbable source of green house gas. If possible, we need to plant the tree as much as possible.</h6>
