 <h1> Endangered polar bear because of melt of glacier. </h1>
 <h2> you might have seen this picture before. there are not enough glacier for them to step on. They can swin but they can't live without ground. A swift melt of glacier made their environment harsh to live. Actually the lack of glacier means that they must swim at least 60~70 miles though they can swim until 100miles depending on bear. increasing distance they have to swim signifies a probability for them to be drowned from exhaustion and hypothermia . Unfortunately,  the number of drowned bear has increased gradually. </h2>
