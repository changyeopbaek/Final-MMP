 <h1>  The destruction of Ozone Layer  </h1>
 <h2> 
An ozone layer filters the Ultra violet ray which is harmful to all of creatures on the Earth and lets a visible ray to pass through and to help the reproduction of plant which is based on food chain of ecosystem. If Ultra Violet ray passes through the Ozone layer, on the ground, it disturbs the photosysthesis of plant and gives rise to decrease of grain production, even makes them perish. To human being, it can result in aging of skin and skin cancer, respiration disorder and a cataract in the eye. On the sea, it melts down the glacier and the rising of sea level from it destroys the ocean ecosystem and bears the unprecedented super hurricane. The Ozone layer has protected not only us but also every creature on the earth from UV as if the umbrella protects us from rain. In reality,an Ozone layer is damaged pretty much and it's on going. </h2>
